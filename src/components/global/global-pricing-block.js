This protective burnt wood layer increases the lifespan of the timber. Charred timbers can last up to 5-10 years without maintenance however it is recommended re-coating the timber more often to keep it hydrated and water resistant." } },{ "@type": "Question", "name": "Can it be used internally?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes this product can be used internally.

As the Shou Sugi Ban is exposed weather the loose particles that causes this issue will wash off the timber from the wind and rain over a few months and the rubbing off will stop.

Is it expensive?", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "As a guide charred cladding will cost you around $35-$75 per m2 more than non-charred timber cladding.
